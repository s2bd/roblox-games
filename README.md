# Open Source Roblox Games
Backup of some of [my games](https://www.roblox.com/communities/35877558/Mux-Games#!/about) on Roblox, so that they are now open-source for everyone.

These are only versions as per the date on which I decided to make them "open source". After downloading the `.rbxl` files, you can open them up in Roblox Studio. Furthermore, you can feel free to import any of the scripts, models, UI, etc. into your own games or projects. The project files herein are all ready-to-play versions of my games, so if you're feeling lazy you can just totally rip them off and hit "publish".
